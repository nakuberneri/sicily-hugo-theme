{{< faq "What do I need to get produced?" >}}
You just need to want to do it. We will need some references to the songs that you like and some lyrics or that you sing the idea of ​​the song. With that we can build something to start working with.

{{< faq "What tools do I need?" >}} You can do it with your mobile phone, if you have more tools like a computer and a microphone and you know how to use them, it will help us. {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "What software can we use to work together?" >}}
If you are recording from your computer, we recommend that you use the software you are already using to record voices; otherwise, we will opt for a secure desktop or mobile solution and an online platform at no additional charge.

Absolutely. In addition to as much written information as possible you’re welcome to provide a rough mix as well as a commercially released reference song for production, mixing or mastering, as these will be useful guides for us to work with.

{{< faq "What format should I send my tracks in?" >}}
WAV or AIFF please.

Uncompressed stereo with a bit depth of at least 16bit, ideally 24bit and a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz up to 96kHz. No pre-processing using limiting or normalising – we need as much headroom as possible to work with to make sure that your tracks sound as good as possible when we master it.

Yes you can! But also send us the dry track and the reverb return track separately. If you have a lot of processes on your tracks, please submit the dry and processed versions of the tracks if possible. They will not be charged as additional tracks in the mix options.
